# H2B_MotionBridge

This Unity project (v2022.3.13f1) is indented for scientific work on human to robot natural motion tranfer in unstructured and unstable environment, in which robots perform object manipulation tasks. 
The heart of the code is based on Unity's ArticulationBodies, driven by NVIDIA's PhysX physics engine for accurate robotic simulation and hand/gripper object interactions during grasping.
